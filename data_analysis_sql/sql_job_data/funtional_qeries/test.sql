-- Rule for the GROUP BY clause
/* Always include in GROUP BY: all non-aggregated columns in SELECT

Aggregated columns (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX…) do not go in GROUP BY

WHERE filters rows before GROUP BY — only rows that pass WHERE are grouped

If you want aggregation across all rows without grouping, you can skip GROUP BY
